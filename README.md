# About

This repo is for keeping track of various "sketches" I make in p5.js. Started July 2020. In the future, I will organize this better... 

If you want to look at these:

- Download repo
- Open `index.html` file in a web browser
- To change the sketch, replace the code in the `sketch.js` file with a section from the `past-sketch.js` file.
